3. your comment on WHY result app STOPPED working after db pod stop
   
   When DB pod is deleted new pod is created with different pod name and worker and result pods restarted their containers without disturbing their pod. 
   From the Front End Entire Application is working also result app, however if result pod connect to old deleted DB pod result app may not work.  
   DB pod lost Entire data (votes) from pod after creating new pod.

4. your answer to HOW YOU MADE THE RESULT POD work.

   After deleting DB pod, worker and result pods restarted. These pods are restarted in program because of exception handling or if-else condition is handled properly. 
   It can be handled from yaml also by adding FailureOnRestart, either ways in yaml and code it cab be handled.
   After restart of result pod, it will get data from new DB pod. Application will work from frontend.
   
5. Some jargons (just names are enough- dont need sentences) that you learnt from the 40-hour Training session

   Docker, Docker Engine, Docker Images, Container, dockerhub, Dockerfile, 
   Process, network, storage isolation
   Kubernetes, Master-worker nodes, cluster, pods, kubectl, API, Controllers, etcd, scheduler, CLI, yaml.
   Replication controller, Replica set, jobs, DaemonSet, Service, Nodeport, Deployment, Load balancer.
   Volumes, Persistent volume, Persistent Volume claim.\
   
6. what happens to the voting and result app after deleting ?

   After deleting voting pod new pod/new container is taken up and from front end application is working. 
   After deleting worker pod new pod/new container is taken up and from front end application is working. Old worker pod logs are deleted. New worker pod is connected to db and redis.
